# GNOME xbacklight bridge

If the GNOME brigthness toggle does nothing but `xbacklight` works then this script might help.

Start the script at login time (eg. in your ~/.profile perhaps) and it will automatically
call `xbacklight` with the gnome brightness value.

Both the brigthness keys and the GNOME brigthness slider work.
